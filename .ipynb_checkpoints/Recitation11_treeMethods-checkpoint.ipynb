    "  * Trees are interpretable. They are amenable to visualization and their visualization can be easily interpreted (if they are small)\n",
    "  * Trees can handle qualitative predictors without having to create dummy variables\n",

    "  * However, trees do not generally have the same predictive accuracy as other regression and classification approaches\n",
