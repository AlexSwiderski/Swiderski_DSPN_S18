Homework 3 responses
1. A. correct B. Correct C. Incorrect.  I did not catch I needed to take the derrivative of 2𝛽1(𝐸[𝑋])2 which made the equation impossible to solve. Looking through your solutation this now makes sense. 
2. I answered this question with a conceptual response rather than a proof.  I was; however, able to follow your proof on the homework 3 solutions.
3. Correct
4. Correct
5. A. Correct B. Correctp-although you forgot to multiply your answer by 1000 in your homework 3 solutions.
6. Correct
7. I would say that my response was correct: "Given that nu and Z are random, we cannot assume a unit increase will result in the same unit increase in Y. However, I did not also uinclude that z is a categorical variable whose values are arbitraryt. 
8. correct
9. correct
10. correct
11. Correct; however, slightly different numbers d/t differences in our random number generators.
